# Biscuit Dashboard Analysis (Excel)

This project focuses on creating an **interactive Excel Dashboard** for analyzing **biscuit sales data**. The project involves **data cleaning**, **data modeling**, and **data visualization**, all completed using Excel‚Äôs core functions. The goal is to provide insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and revenue trends through a well-designed, user-friendly dashboard.

## Project Overview

This Excel dashboard includes several key features to analyze and visualize the data:

- **Data Cleaning**: The raw data was cleaned directly within Excel, using various Excel functions like **sorting**, **filtering**, and **removing duplicates** to ensure the data is consistent and usable.
  
- **Data Modeling**: Data was organized into structured tables for easy analysis, creating relationships between different aspects of the data (e.g., customer, product, sales).
  
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs were created within Excel to visualize key metrics like revenue, customer segmentation, and sales trends.

### Key Features of the Dashboard:

- **Revenue and Profit Analysis**: Display total revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), and profit margins over different periods.
  
- **Customer Segmentation**: Analyze revenue by **age group**, **gender**, and **payment method**.
  
- **Geographical Insights**: Visualize revenue performance by location (e.g., regions or cities).

- **Sales Trends**: Track revenue performance on a **monthly**, **quarterly**, and **weekly** basis to spot seasonality and trends.

### Data Cleaning and Filtering in Excel:
- **Cleaning**: The raw data was cleaned using Excel‚Äôs built-in functions such as **remove duplicates**, **find and replace**, and **sorting** to correct inconsistencies.
  
- **Filtering**: Various filters were applied to segment the data by relevant attributes, such as payment methods, age groups, or locations.

### Data Visualization:
- **Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts**: Used to dynamically summarize the data and create visual representations of key metrics.
  
- **Slicers**: Added to the dashboard to allow users to filter the data interactively and view different segments of the data.

- **Conditional Formatting**: Applied to highlight key data points, such as top-performing customers or low-performing regions.

## Acknowledgments

- **Microsoft Excel**: The primary tool used for creating the interactive dashboard, data cleaning, and visualizations.
  
- **Data Cleaning**: All data cleaning and filtering were done directly within Excel using standard functions like **sorting**, **filtering**, **removing duplicates**, and **manual adjustments**.
  
- **Data Visualization**: **Pivot Tables**, **Pivot Charts**, and **Slicers** were used to create interactive, dynamic visualizations that allow for deeper analysis of the sales data.
